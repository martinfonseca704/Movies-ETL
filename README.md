# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
  Amazing prime video is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on amazing prime. The worlds largest online retailer the amazing prime video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming right at a bargain. To inspire the team have some fun and connect with the local coding community amazing crime has decided to sponsor a hackathon providing a clean data set of movie data and asking participants to predict the popular pictures. Brita a member of the amazing prime video team has been tasked with creating the data sets for the hackathon there are two data sources a scrapper for Wikipedia for all movies released in 1990 and rating data from the movielens website she’ll need to extract the data it from the two sources transform it into one clean dataset and finally load that that dataset into sql table.
   Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
